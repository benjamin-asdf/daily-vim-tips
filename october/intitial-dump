vim tip of the day: zz to move the screen so the cursor is in the middle. I through that one out there just because I use it so damn often
very often I do: Lzz
or Hzz

---------

I am using now :vsplit a lot

---------

Sometimes I use % on bracket to see the scope :slightly_smiling_face:

---------

This reminds me of "folding". For me it is bound to z- most useful za to toggle fold. zc close fold, zo open.

Tip for today. :slightly_smiling_face: You can jump section (I use it for function definitions with [[ or ]])

You can jump paragraphs with { and }
And sentences with ( )

---------

Did you know that gi and gv resume the last insert or visual states? (I don't use those enough)

---------

If I would see for example this HTTPServer and I would like to have it like HttpServer
I would got to first T and than holding shift and I would press ~ three times S-~ to change the capitalization to HttpServer

---------

`dip` to delete white space
